            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, My Name is Zayn Ul-Haq! I am currently a Computer Science Undergraduate studying at the Manchester Metropolitan University. I have completed my Second-Year finishing with both a 1st Class in both years. I love to brainstorm ideas and bring them to life using my programming and problem-solving skills. This portfolio serves as a personal archive on the projects I am proud to showcase to others. Just like this website which is also developed by me!
                <br>
                <br>
                THIS WEBSITE IS A W.I.P

                <h3>Quick POS</h3>
                <p>Initially a University project, this website was a group collaboration with a few classmates that served as a POS system in which users are able to customise to their business’ needs. Although it wasn’t a complete project it was a MVP but I have taken the liberty to fix and smooth out features as well as implement some new ones too. This project was spearheaded by myself and I put the most hours into to ensure that this was completed.
                    <br>
                    The POS system allows the user to sign in or create an account for their business. Once singed in you are able to create an admin account in which it will possess the ability to add, append or delete items as well as do the same will employees. No sensitive data is stored on this software to ensure data security. This Pos system is mainly used on store floor as I have experience using a POS there so it works as one.

                <h3>Home Choice Catalogue</h3>
                <p>A Personal Project to help my dad showcase the plethora of beds he sells to customers in the form of a catalogue. This will help customers look for specific beds they would like to purchase and can help discussions with my dad to simplify orders. It gives customers freedom in choosing and will implement an AI feature that will just change the colour of a bed to save spending loads od money making sample beds with different colours.
                    <br>
                    This also serves as a statement from myself to show that AI can be used within our lives and help impact in a small way but also positively in simplifying the orders for both supplier, wholesaler and customer.
